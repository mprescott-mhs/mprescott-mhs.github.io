	    <p>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly 
		    satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great 
		    work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. 
		    Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.</p>
